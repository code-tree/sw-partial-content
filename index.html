    <h1>Service worker and ranged responses</h1>
    <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Service worker spec does not currently include any way to handle 206 partial content requests ('range' header). When the browser requests a ranged response, Chrome 52 stops playing e.g. audio or video, and may throw errors too.
    <p><strong>Work-around:</strong> Manually implement a ranged response during fetch event (based on [this sample page](https://samdutton.github.io/samples/service-worker/prefetch-video/)).
    <h2>Test audio</h2>
    <p>After the SW has installed and is controlling the page, try randomly moving the play location (while playing the audio), which should trigger a range request in Chrome.
    <p>
        Served by SW without any range support.
        <br>
        <audio controls src='audio.mp3'></audio>
    </p>
    <p>
        Served by SW with (limited) range support.
        <br>
        <audio controls src='audio.mp3?ranged'></audio>
    </p>
